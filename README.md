Okay, so, I just walked out of the theater after watching Antes del cuerpo and my brain is a bit scrambled. You know the feeling when you've had too much coffee but you still feel like a nap? That's how my mind is right now. First thing that hit me: the colors. Oh man, the colors had this vibe like an old photo from the '70s, but in the best way possible. Like the directors wanted you to feel nostalgic for something you never experienced. Why does that work so well? No idea. Maybe that’s why I’m a pastry chef and not a filmmaker.

The plot though... it was like a puff pastry with a filling that keeps surprising you. At first, you’re thinking it’ll be sweet, then bam! It hits you with a savory twist. It’s not exactly what I expected from a movie with a title like Antes del cuerpo. Kinda sounds like a workout video or something, doesn't it? Oh, and the characters! They felt like those improperly baked croissants where you think you see who they are, but then they peel away layer by layer. Keeps you guessing.

> At one point, I'm pretty sure I was just staring at the screen with my mouth open. Someone has GOT to teach those actors how to teleport emotions directly into your brain. But the music...ugh, I can't decide if it was genius or just distracting. There were moments I felt like I was in a melodrama and others in a weird, artsy horror show. Not judging though, it had a certain je ne sais quoi, I guess?

And, I mean, let's talk about the pace. It was like a leisurely Sunday brunch that suddenly turns into last call at the bar. Some parts just dragged on, and I was internally yelling, Get on with it already! Yet, others just whisked by like a piping-hot soufflé collapsing despite all your efforts. But who am I kidding? I was still in it, all the way. When a movie makes you mad and thrilled all at once—kind of like that feeling when you accidentally download the movie instead of streaming it—you're onto something.

Here's a random thought. The dialogue sometimes felt like when you add cardamom to a recipe without really knowing why. But then, sometimes those spontaneous experiments surprise you with how well they work. Maybe that was the point.

```csharp
var feelings = new List<string>{confused, intrigued, annoyed};
foreach (var feeling in feelings)
{
    Console.WriteLine(feeling);
}
```

So, yeah, go watch the movie if you want, or download it. I still don't know if I loved or hated it, but then again, isn't that the mark of something that gets under your skin? Like a fine dough that never quite turns out right but you can't help but try again. Give it a go, see where it lands with you. Maybe bring a friend so you can argue about it later. Makes for interesting conversation over tea. Or wine. Definitely wine.
